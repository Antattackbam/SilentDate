    <h3>"Shh...from the moment you start this date there will be no talking and no electronics(yes, that means put those phones away. You can do it)"</h3>
</div>
<div id="opening2"><h6>(Another insert explaing the importance of non verbal communication)</h6>
    <h3> "Making and maintaining eye contact, facial expressions, and bodily gestures are all examples of nonverbal communication. 
    In our relationships, we must understand that nonverbal communication plays is crucial in feelings 
    of security as well as creating a feeling of connection and affection. On this date we will practice those skills."</h3></div>
<div id="Activity1"><h5>---Falling in Love ---</h5>
   <h3> Using the including hourglass, look in each other eyes until time is up.
    (Over 25 years ago, psychologist Arthur Aron 
    succeeded in making two strangers fall in love in his laboratory by having them stare into
    each other's eyes for 4 minutes.)</h3></div>
<div id ="Activity2"><h5>---Pantomime Game ---</h5>
   <h3> Practice your non verbal communication skills. Start the timer and see how many cards your partner can guess. Remember, no talking!
   --Card Ideas
     -Your favorite hobby
     -Partners favorite hobby
     -Scene from last move watched together
     -Someone you both know
     -One of your pets/favorite animal</h3></div>
<div id="Activity3"><h5>---Write a Story ---</h5>
    <h3>Take the included Storybook. You will notice it is empty. See how creative you can get when you are not focused on verbal communication. 
    Each of you will take turns and write a single sentence (or if you are up for the challenge, a single word!),
     and see what kind of story you both can conjur up. We would love to see what you come up with!</div>
<div id="Activity4"><h5>---Appreication Notes --- </h5>
    <h3>Take the sheet labeled 'Appreciation'. You will notice there are 6 blank boxes. Cut or tear these so that you both have 3 pieces each. 
    Start the timer and write the 3 things you appreciate about your partner the most. When the time is up, you will give 2 of the 3 pieces to your partner.
    With the other, you will hide it somewhere for your partner to find later. Hopefully this will brighten their day and demonstrate just how important
    nonverbal communication really is.</h3> </div>
